Help file on how to setup the DeathCauses-section of config.yml.

Note: This file only contains help information and changes to it don't affect the plugin.

Formatting looks like that (general placeholders):
   {CAUSE}:
       keep-inventory: false/true
       cost: NUMBER/PERCENTAGE
       method: auto/command
       timeout: NUMBER
       loss-percentage: NUMBER
       whitelist:
       - listname
       - anotherlistname
       blacklist:
       - evillistname
       - ...



For {CAUSE}, insert one of the following cause names:
 - CACTUS
        when died from a cactus
 - SUFFOCATION
        when died because player was stuck in a block
 - FALL
        when died due to fall damage
 - VOID
        when died in the void
 - SUICIDE
        when died from a command like /kill
 - STARVATION
        when starved
 - LIGHTNING
        when struck by lightning
 - DROWNING
        when died because player drowned in water
 - LAVA
        when died in lava
 - FIRE
        when died of fire
 - FIRE|tick
        when died because player was burning, but didn't still stand in a fire
        -> This is a child of the FIRE cause. More about childs after this section.
 - EXPLOSION
        when an explosion killed the player (for example TNT, Ghast's fireball)
        Note: does not refer to creeper explosions. See MOB-creeper for that.
 - MOB
        when player was killed by any mob
 - MOB|creeper
        when player was killed by a creeper
        -> This is a child of the MOB cause. More about childs after this section.
 - MOB|wolf
        when player was killed by a wolf
        -> This is a child of the MOB cause. More about childs after this section.
 - PLAYER
        when player was killed by another player (pvp)
 - UNKNOWN
        when the death matches no other listed death cause
        should only occur when there are damage causes added/modified with bukkit updates

(cause names are case-insensitive)

======= What are child causes? =======
A child cause automatically inherits the settings from its parent.
You can override those settings, but you don't need to do anything if you don't want special treatment for that specific thing.
Childs can be easily recognized by the '|' character that seperates their "meta" from the main cause name (which is their parent).



       
Each cause CAN have the listed properties.
You DO NOT always need to define every property!
When not defined, the default will be used (see below).

Possible properties of a death cause:
   
   keep-inventory
     values: true or false
     default: false
     description: specifies if items should be kept on death.
   
   cost
     values: any number; may be a decimal if you're economy plugin supports decimals; may be a percentage marked by a '%'-sign to subtract a percentage of the player's current money.
     default: 0
     description: the cost that the player pays to keep their items (if keep-inventory = true); no items will be kept if they don't have enough money; if keep-inventory equals false, the money will still be claimed if possible
   
   method
     values: auto or command
     default: auto
     description: if set to "command", players need to use a command (/death back) to get back their items.
                  if set to "auto" (default), players get them back automatically when they respawn
   
   timeout
     values: any integer
     default: 15
     description: ONLY USE WHEN USING THE "command" METHOD!
                  sets the time in second the player has to perform the "/death back"-command.
                  after the time has passed, the saved items will be dropped at the death location.
   
   loss-percentage
     values: any number between 0 and 100
     default: 0
     description: specifies what percentage of the player's items will still be dropped upon death
                  0 keeps all items (default), 100 would drop all items, 50 would drop half of the items and so on
   
   whitelist
     values: a list of list-names specified in lists.txt
     default: none
     description: if set, only items that are in one of the given lists will be kept - the rest will drop
                  more information about lists in lists.txt
   
   blacklist
     values: a list of list-names specified in lists.txt
     default: none
     description: same as whitelist, but reversed. any item that is in one of the given lists will always drop (overrides whitelists)


AGAIN: When you don't define an option for a cause, the default one will be used!



============= EXAMPLES ================


Easy Example:
   VOID:
       keep-inventory: true
       method: command
       timeout: 30

Explanation: When the player falls in the void (below bedrock), all of his items will be saved. He will still respawn with an empty inventory, but he can get back his items within 30 seconds via a command.




Other Example:
   PLAYER:
       keep-inventory: true
       cost: 40%
       loss-percentage: 25
       whitelist:
       - valuables
       - diamondtools

Explanation: When a player is killed by another player, 75% of his valuables and diamond tools will be kept & saved and he pays 300 of his money. He will get back the kept items when he respawns.





Example including childs:
    MOB:
        keep-inventory: true
        loss-percentage: 50
        method: command
        timeout: 60
    MOB|creeper:
        loss-percentage: 0
        method: auto

Explanation: When a player is killed by a regular mob, he will keep 50% of his items and can get them back within 60 seconds via command.
             When a player is killed by a creeper, all of his items will be kept and automatically given back on respawn.
    
If nothing would be defined for MOB|creeper, a death caused by a creeper would be handled the same way as by a regular MOB.
