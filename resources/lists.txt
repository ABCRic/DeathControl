# Every new list starts with $list, followed by its name.
# Below that line, you put every item/block that belongs to the list.
#
# Allowed are the block/item IDs or their names.
# List of IDs: http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Data_values
# List of names: http://jd.bukkit.org/apidocs/org/bukkit/Material.html#enum_constant_summary
# If you are not sure about a name, just use the ID.
# You can also specify a data value by attaching it with a colon (:)
# For example, 351:15 would only match bone meal.
